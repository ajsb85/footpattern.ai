## Technology Stack

We chose to build this application using Flutter and Supabase for several reasons:

- **Flutter**: Flutter offers a fantastic framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications with a single codebase. This ensures that our app is accessible on both Android and iOS devices, saving development time and resources.

- **Supabase**: Supabase serves as the backbone of our app, providing a secure and scalable database solution. Supabase's real-time features ensure that attendance data is always up to date and accessible from anywhere. Its authentication and authorization features guarantee data privacy and security.

- **Real-time Updates**: We've integrated real-time attendance tracking and updates, ensuring that data is always up to date and accessible.

- **Geolocation Integration**: Employees can now verify their check-ins and check-outs using geolocation features, adding an extra layer of accuracy and security to attendance tracking.
 
## Challenges and Future Features

While developing the **footpattern**, we encountered various challenges, including:

- **Push Notifications**: Implementing push notifications to remind employees of their upcoming shifts and to provide status updates.

- **Reporting and Analytics**: Introducing comprehensive reporting and analytics tools to help employers gain insights into attendance trends.
