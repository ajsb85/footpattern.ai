- **Supabase**: Supabase serves as the backbone of our app, providing a secure and scalable database solution. Supabase's real-time features ensure that attendance data is always up to date and accessible from anywhere. Its authentication and authorization features guarantee data privacy and security.

## Challenges and Future Features

While developing the **Employee Attendance App**, we encountered various challenges, including:

- **Security**: Ensuring data security was a top priority. We implemented robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data.

In the future, we have exciting plans to enhance the app further, including:

- **Push Notifications**: Implementing push notifications to remind employees of their upcoming shifts and to provide status updates.

- **Reporting and Analytics**: Introducing comprehensive reporting and analytics tools to help employers gain insights into attendance trends.
