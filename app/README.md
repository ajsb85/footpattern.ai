## Technology Stack

We chose to build this application using Flutter and Supabase for several reasons:

- **Flutter**: Flutter offers a fantastic framework for developing cross-platform mobile applications with a single codebase. This ensures that our app is accessible on both Android and iOS devices, saving development time and resources.

- **Supabase**: Supabase serves as the backbone of our app, providing a secure and scalable database solution. Supabase's real-time features ensure that attendance data is always up to date and accessible from anywhere. Its authentication and authorization features guarantee data privacy and security.

## Challenges and Future Features

While developing the **Employee Attendance App**, we encountered various challenges, including:

- **Real-time Updates**: Implementing real-time attendance tracking and updates required careful planning and execution. We overcame this challenge by leveraging Supabase's real-time features.

- **Security**: Ensuring data security was a top priority. We implemented robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data.

In the future, we have exciting plans to enhance the app further, including:

- **Geolocation Integration**: Adding geolocation features to verify employee check-ins and check-outs.

- **Push Notifications**: Implementing push notifications to remind employees of their upcoming shifts and to provide status updates.

- **Reporting and Analytics**: Introducing comprehensive reporting and analytics tools to help employers gain insights into attendance trends.
