## _Motivation_

The significant influence of technology has brought about changes in working cultures, with flexible working hours replacing traditional 9 to 5 jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic has further transformed flexible working cultures into remote working and hybrid office patterns. In such working scenarios, tracking, storing, and managing employee data with manual practices becomes tedious for organizations. As more businesses incline towards technologically activated work settings that provide better control of employee discipline and enable them to keep track of their performance, well-planned attendance management systems take center stage.

Automated attendance systems are different from traditional employee management systems in that they are integrated with various modern features and functionalities that empower organizations with a simple digital platform to manage the attendance of employees. Automated attendance management systems can enhance employee productivity and save money, provide accurate attendance records, record all employee data automatically, are easy to integrate, reduce admin load, and offer many other benefits.

To create a successful employee time tracking and attendance management app, it is essential to consider features such as employee signup, biometrics, facial recognition, payroll integration support, cloud-based support, workforce management, electronic timesheets, managing shift schedules, tracking overtime, simple and easy use interface, reporting functionalities, and push notifications. When building an employee time tracking app, one needs to hire an excellent development team, including a Business Analyst, project manager, app developer, app tester, and UI/UX designer that can handle the complexity of the project and ensure a quality solution.

The cost of developing an employee time and attendance management app depends on several factors such as the complexity of the app structure, choice of operating system, features and functionalities, UI/UX design, quality assurance, app testing, technology requirements, and advancements, and the app development team's hourly cost. The average cost of developing an employee time tracking system is around USD 20,000 to USD 25,000+ for each platform.

In conclusion, with the increasing flexibility in the work culture, it is important to consider implementing automated employee time and attendance management systems to monitor employee time and attendance and manage payroll. Hiring a mobile app development company can help organizations implement the best systems that offer enhanced employee experience and improved business productivity.
